    <h2><u>Strengths</u></h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Patience</p> </h3>
    
    <p>I'm a really collected, intelligent person, and I know the benefits of patience. <br>
        There will be difficulties, therefore patience is necessary. <br> 
        There will be individuals that annoy you and circumstances that aggravate you. <br>
        If you're patient, you retain your focus on the task at hand. Instead of complaining, find a solution.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ambitious</h3>

    <p>  I'm ambitious, and in fact, I consider it to be one of my best qualities.<br>
         In some ways, having ambition raises my bar for success. <br>
         I am ambitious, thus I have higher life goals that are challenging to accomplish and are frequently the key to a successful life.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Versatile</h3>
    <p>
        My versatility is without a doubt one of my strongest traits. <br>
        Simply said, my ability to be versatile helps me to maximize my productivity. <br>
        I can take use of diverse skill sets by going beyond established job descriptions. <br>
    </p>

    <br><br><br>
    <p>
        I've watched myself develop throughout the years. <br>
        Due to my impatience, which was one of my greatest flaws, I often lost out on opportunities by moving too quickly. <br>
        However, because I am ambitious, I have fought to overcome this weakness through the years, and it is now one of my greatest strengths. <br>
        I continue to develop my strengths in order to go above and beyond my goals. <br>

    </p>

    <h2><u>The Summary Of The Book <q>Twelve Pillars</q>(Chapter 4-7)</u></h2>
    <p>Several things were evident to me after reading the chapters.  <br>
     In essence, the book Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener demonstrated the importance of setting both short- and long-term goals. <br>
     Additionally, it is clear that they placed a strong focus on using time wisely and not wasting it on useless activities. <br>
     It can also be seen that you should be careful who you associate with, for example, if you associate with lazy individuals, you will eventually become lazy yourself. <br>
    Finally, always strive to learn new things; it is never too late to do so.</p> <br>

    <p>
        My eyes were opened to several shortcomings that I possess after reading the book. <br>
        I waste a lot of time on things that aren't really necessary, like watching hours of YouTube. <br>
         If I could cut down on that time and use the extra time for something more useful, I know my life would be better. <br>
         Daily knowledge increase is a wonderful habit to form because it will increase my understanding and make me more versatile. <br>
