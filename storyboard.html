        <h2><u>Purpose of each Page </u></h2>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Home Page </h3>
        <p>the homepage's function is to direct visitors to the pages that provide the necessary information. <br>
        it is also where my contact information lies</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Personal Page</h3>
        <p>this page serves to give the target audience information about myself in order for them to understand who I am and my personal interests.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Professional Page</h3>
        <p>My qualifications and past accomplishments are displayed on my professional profile.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Personal development page</h3>
        <p>This page serves to highlight all of my strengths as well as areas where I believe I can still do better.<br>
        It also reflects my opinions of the book Twelve Pillars and what I learned from it.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Storyboard</h3>
        <p>A storyboard serves as a roadmap. <br>
        It is made before the finished product is generated.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Reference</h3>
        <p>By using references, I can recognize how other authors and researchers contributed to my work.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h2><u>Theme and Target Audience</u></h2>
        <p>This has a dark green background with white text as its theme. <br>
        Since this is a personal website, I decided to use this background because it reflected one of my favorite shades of green. <br>
        The white font was chosen since it contrasted sharply with the color and stood out the most. <br>
        <br>
        The intended audience consists of those who are inquiring about me.
